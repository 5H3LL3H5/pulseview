The sigrok project aims at creating a portable, cross-platform,
Free/Libre/Open-Source signal analysis software suite that supports various
device types (such as logic analyzers, oscilloscopes, multimeters, and more).

PulseView is a Qt-based GUI for sigrok.


Status
------

PulseView is currently work in progress. Some basic functionality
is there, but it should still be considered alpha/beta stage software.

There have been no official tarball releases, yet.

Distro packagers should NOT package this, yet.
